# Wpf Sample Application
I created this to learn about Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and .NET Core. I have used Visual Studio 2022. I will try to explore WPF Controls, Windows, Pages, Navigation, Layouts, Styling, Data Binding, Triggers, Images. 

The main issue I am doing this is I want to see how I can show SVG images in WPF. There is no built in way to do that. I will try to figure out how to do that and long the way learn about the fundamentals of WPF. Since .NET MAUI also uses XAML, it will help me in the future.
